# Custom-bot

Custom-bot is a customized chatbot on facebook written in Laravel by using Facebook messenger API for sending messages. The bot represents an expert system that can be modified for a specific system by adding a set of rules (conditions and conclusions).

My version is a customized decision support system that offers faculties which are adjusted to your ability and interests.
You can also insert your own set of rules in the database or put JSON file into storage and run command:
```sh
$ php artisan json:import
```
